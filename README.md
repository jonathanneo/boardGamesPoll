# boardGamesPoll README  
## Purpose  
the purpose of the web application, explaining both the context and the social choice mechanism used.  
The purpose of this web application is to provide a board games ranking website for board games players around the world. We saw the lack of polling websites for board games and decided to create a more modern and functional web application for this purpose. The social choice mechanism we used is to enable users to create polls where they can then add options which users (only logged in users) can vote for which option suits the poll best.
